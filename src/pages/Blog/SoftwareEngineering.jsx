        <p><cite>Humanity is now faced with a new set of challengesâ€”climate change and extreme
          weather, declining natural resources, an increasing world population to be fed and
          housed, international terrorism, and the need to help elderly people lead satisfying
          and fulfilled lives. We need new technologies to help us address these problems and,
          for sure, software will play a central role in these technologies.</cite></p>
