# **Big O**

Is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.

**O (big O)**: Upper bound (worse case).

**Ω (big Omega)**: Lower bound (best case).

**Θ (big theta)**: Tight bounds (expected case).

From **best** to **worse**:
1. Θ(1) - Constant
2. Θ(log n) - Logarithmic
3. Θ(n) - Linear
4. Θ(n log n) - Constant
5. Θ(n²)
6. Θ(nˣ)
7. O(n!)

### **Time Complexity**
How long does it take to run the algorithm?

### **Space Complexity (memory)**
How much space does it need simultaneously?
